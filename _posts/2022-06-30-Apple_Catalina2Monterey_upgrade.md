Knowing that I'm going to lose my current daily job, the next thing I planed to do on our home computer infrastructure after the [DSM 7 upgrade](Synology_DSM7_upgrade) was to also upgrade the macOS operating system on my MacBook Pro from Catalina to the latest version of Monterey as soon as I could.
