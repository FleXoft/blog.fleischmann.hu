Knowing that I'm going to lose my current job, the next thing I planed to do on our home computer infrastructure after the [DSM 7 upgrade](Synology_DSM7_upgrade) was to also upgrade the macOS operating system on my MacBook Pro from Catalina to the latest version of Monterey as soon as I could.

## Checklist after the upgrade process:

- VPN CHECK: âœ…
- VMware Fusion upgrade + CHECK: âœ…
- brew upgrade + CHECK: âœ…
- Time Machine backup CHECK: âœ…
- Apple xCode upgrade + CHECK: âœ…
- so far incompatible Apps upgrade + CHECK: âœ…
- printer CHECK: âœ…
- Steam CHECK: âœ…

After a little more than an hour, all the expected functions are working fine again. ðŸ¤ž
