## The Weekend Whip (Lego Ninjago Official Theme Song)

<center><pre>
It's time for training and we're getting started
it's on, you know
and we wanna see you whip and shout it
we rock, you roll.
they say, go slow
and everything just stands so still
we say go go!
we're ready for the fight, we know the drill
Monday morning and we feel defeated,
seems so long ago
Tuesday's comin' we just keep on beatin 'til we're in our zone
they say, go slow
and everything just stands so still
we say, go go! you're gonna see us rip into it, just
jump up kick back whip around and spin
and then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja
come on, come on, we're gonna do it again
we just jump up kick back whip around and spin
and then we jump back, do it again
Ninja-Go! Ninja, come on, come on, and do the weekend whip yeah!
Wednesday mornin' and we soon discover we gotta push our game
we slept on Thursday just to get it over, the whip's a day away!
they say, go slow!
and everything just stands so still

we say, go go!
you're gonna see us rip into it,
just jump up kick back whip around and spin
and then we jump back, do it again
